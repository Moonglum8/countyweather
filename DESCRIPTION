Description: Interacts with NOAA data sources (including the NCDC API at
  http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2 and ISD data), using
  functions from the rnoaa package, to obtain and compile weather time series,
  including for precipitation and temperature, for U.S. counties. This work was
  supported in part by grants from the National Institute of Environmental
  Health Sciences (R00ES022631) and the Colorado State University Water
  Center.
