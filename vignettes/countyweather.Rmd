```

## Setting up to use the package

Currently, this package exists in a development version on GitHub. To use the function, you need to install it directly from GitHub using the `install_github` function from `devtools`. Further, the package relies on some functions that are in a development version of `rnoaa`, so you need to install that version of the `rnoaa` package. 

You can use the following code for this set-up: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("ropenscilabs/rnoaa")
install_github("leighseverson/countyweather", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library(countyweather)
```
