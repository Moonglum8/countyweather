\usage{
write_hourly_timeseries(fips, year, coverage = NULL, var = "all",
  out_directory, data_type = "rds", metadata_type = "rds",
  average_data = TRUE, station_label = FALSE, keep_map = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fips}{A character string of the five-digit U.S. FIPS code of a U.S.
county.}

\item{year}{a four digit number or vector of numbers indicating the year or
years for which you want to pull hourly data. Values for \code{year} can
be in the range from 1901 to the current year.}

\item{coverage}{A numeric value in the range of 0 to 1 that specifies
the desired percentage coverage for the weather variable (i.e., what
percent of each weather variable must be non-missing to include data from
a monitor when calculating daily values averaged across monitors.)}

\item{var}{A character vector specifying desired weather variables. For
example, var = c("wind_speed", "temperature"). The core weather variables
available include \code{c("wind_direction", "wind_speed", "ceiling_height",
"visibility_distance", "temperature", "temperature_dewpoint",
"air_pressure")}. Alternatively, you can specify var = "all" to include
additional flag and quality codes.}

\item{out_directory}{The absolute or relative pathname for the directory
where you would like the time series files to be saved.}

\item{data_type}{A character strign indicating that you would like either
.rds files (data_type = "rds") or .csv files (data_type = "csv") for the
time series output. This option defaults to .rds files.}

\item{metadata_type}{A character string indicating that you would like either
.rds files (metadata_type = "rds") or .csv files (metadata_type = "csv")
for the station and county metadata output. This option defaults to .rds
files, in which case a list of four elements is saved
(\code{station_metadata}, \code{radius}, \code{lat_center}, and
\code{lon_center}). If the user specified "csv" output, \code{radius},
\code{lat_center}, and \code{lon_center} are added to the
\code{station_metadata} dataframe as additional columns.}

\item{average_data}{TRUE / FALSE to indicate if you want the function to
average daily weather data across multiple monitors.}

\item{keep_map}{TRUE / FALSE indicating if a map of the stations should
be included. The map can substantially increase the size of the files. If
FALSE, the "maps" subdirectory will not be created.}

\item{verbose}{TRUE / FALSE to indicate if you want the function to print
out the county or vector of counties it's saving files for.}
}
\value{
Writes out three subirectories of a fiven directory with hourly
weather files saved in "data", station and county metadata saved in
"metadata", and a map of weather station locations saved in "maps" for each
FIPS code specified. The user can specify either .rds or .csv files for the
data and metadatafiles, using the arguments \code{data_type} and
\code{metadata_type}, respectively. Maps are saved as .png files.
}
\description{
Given a vector of U.S. county FIPS codes, this function saves each element of
the lists created from the function \code{daily_fips} to a separate folder
within a fiven directory. The dataframe \code{daily_data} is saved to a
subdirectory of the given directory called "data." This time series dataframe
gives 1. the values for specified weather variables, and 2. the number of
weather stations contributing to the average for each day within the
specified year(s). Metadata information about the weather stations and
county are saved in a list with four elements in a subdirectory called
"metadata." These elements include \code{station_metadata} (station metadata
for stations contributing to the time series dataframe), \code{radius}
(the radius (in km) within which weather stations were pulled from each
county's center), \code{lat_center}, and \code{lon_center} (the latitude
and longitude of the county's center). If the user specifies "csv" ouput for
the \code{metadata_type}, argument, \code{radius}, \code{lat_center}, and
\code{lon_center} are added to the \code{station_metadata} dataframe as three
additional columns.
}
\note{
If the function is unable to pull weather data for a particular county
   given the specified percent coverage, date range, and/or weather variables,
   \code{write_hourly_timeseries} will not produce a file for that county.
